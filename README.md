A user gets a unique ID upon installation of the App without collecting any personal info. After getting the neccessary permissions from the user, it will track the locations the user has visted for the past 14 days. If in case a particular user is tested positive, his tracking data is used to warn other people who are visiting a location visited by the diagonised patient.
